NG Colour Lovers
================

A sample app built with AngularJS that utilizes the [ColourLovers API](http://www.colourlovers.com/api). 

This project has examples of how to use:

* A JSONP call with callback to avoid CORS issues
* Routing to change the views
* HTTP calls and promises
* Services and an extremely simplified cache across controllers
* Grunt as a build pipeline
* Bower for web dependencies
